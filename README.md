# [Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice)

- This is my solution to the [Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice) challenge on freeCodeCamp Back End Development Certification.
- The challenge is to create a Node.js application that takes in a unix timestamp and returns a string containing the date in human-readable format.
- I have also added kubernetes configuration files while learning to deploy microservices on kubernetes (it doesn't affect the solution for freeCodeCamp).
